This project explored how natural disasters affect the energy industry by analyzing FEMA data from 2004 to 2015 and visualizing the findings through Tableau multi-maps (also called Trellis charts).

I analyzed nationwide disaster data to pinpoint which four types of natural disasters had the greatest impact on energy companies and their refineries. Using Tableau, I focused on mapping and ranking these disasters to show geographic patterns and frequency across the U.S.

Key Workflows:
- Data Integration: Imported FEMA disaster data into Tableau and manually added refinery location data to link disaster incidents to specific facilities.
- Geospatial Mapping: Used Tableauâ€™s mapping tools to plot disaster locations and refinery sites across the lower 48 states. Each disaster type was color-coded, with refineries and disasters represented by distinct custom shapes.
- Interactive Exploration: Built filters for disaster types and states, enabling users to drill down into specific regions or disaster events.
- Trellis Chart Design: Created multi-maps that displayed the top four disaster types side by side. This required custom calculated fields to rank disaster frequency and organize the maps into quadrants for easy comparison.
- Annotations & Insights: Added map annotations for key refinery sites and summarized which disasters posed the highest operational risk. The project concluded with a Tableau Story that combined all visualizations into a clear, narrative-driven report.

Tools & Techniques:
- Tableau for visualization and Trellis chart creation
- Calculated fields and ranking logic for data analysis
- Custom icons, color schemes, and interactive filters for better user experience

Overall, the project demonstrated how geospatial and visual analytics can uncover meaningful insights about how natural disasters disrupt energy operations and help identify areas of greatest vulnerability.
